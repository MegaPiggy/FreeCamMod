# Free Cam Mod v.1.0.0
Mod for the Alpha Outer Wilds version 1.2 that adds a free cam to the game

### How do I install it?

0. Follow instalation of [DIMOWA](https://github.com/ShoosGun/DIMOWA) if you haven't already. 
1. Download the dll from one of the [releases](https://github.com/ShoosGun/FreeCamMod/releases).
2. Place the dll from the mod in the `mods` folder.
3. Run the installer.

### How do I uninstall it?

Using [DIMOWA](https://github.com/ShoosGun/DIMOWA), select the uninstall option.

### What it does?

It allows the player to use a freecam while in the game ( the cam still doesn't work in the main menu )

### How do I use it?

1. Press **CapsLock**, it will activate the camera

2. Use **WASD** to move and **TAB** to go faster

3. Press **CapsLock** again if you want to go back to the player's camera

### Things to keep in mind

- There could be some bugs, so please send a *issue* about what you find in this repo.

- The player will *slide* in the ground if the player was in the air when activating the camera. 

- Pressing **Esc** would open the settings menu normaly, but if you are in the free cam it won't apear, so press **CapsLock** again to go back to it. The game will freeze in that state, but not **you** *(ZA WARUDO)*, so it's a good way to take pictures while everything is static.

- The camera might appear to be going up or down sometimes, that is caused by the rotation of the planets.
